    "description":"“The Seventh Course: How Rustam Slays the White Div” (Firdawsi 1010, 59)\n\nThe Shahnameh is a masterpiece of epic poetry made more captivating by the rich illuminations that have decorated copies of its verses since the 13th century (Clinton and Simpson 2006). The true depth of understanding requires that we consider the Shahnameh in all its complexities: the interplay between Islam and Zoroastrianism, its position as a magnum opus within Persian culture and the censorship and translation difficulties it has endured (Lewis 2015). When faced with such a manuscript as this, we must consider the cultural and political value of the stories to the Persian people as a piece born from revitalized Persian culture after Arabian conquest (Ferhat-Holzman 2001) and the artistic evolution in manuscript production that arose out of Timurid Persia which would go on to influence later styles (Robinson 1958).\n\nCommissioned in the mid 15th century by the Timurid king Ibrahim Sultan of Shiraz for his brother Baysungur of Herat – this manuscript is one more piece in the artistic and cultural rivalry that existed between the two cities at the time (Robinson 1958). The Shahnameh itself is an account of ancient Persian history and an affirmation of the oppressed Persian culture and language through its subjects and poetry (Ferhat-Holzman 2001). It contains hints of Zoroastrian influence preserved in spite of Islamic censorship (Lewis 2015) such as the conflict between cosmic good and evil – a battle for which all people must one day pledge a side (Foltz 2010).\n\nHow Rustam Slays the White Div\n\nUnder the guidance of Ulad, the hero, Rustam, has arrived in the city where Shah Kai Kaus is being held captive along with the rest of the Iranian army. The Shah has been blinded by his captors and victory for the Iranians remains out of reach, but with Rustam’s aid they may begin to turn the tide. First, they must cure the blindness afflicting the Shah and remove the threat of the White Div and his armies…(Firdawsi 1010, 57-59)"},

    "description":"“He took Ulad and made Raksh go like wind” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 59)\n\nRustam, like many other heroes, relies upon his trusty steed Raksh for transport, companionship, and even defence. Rustam’s connection with Raksh verges upon the supernatural – perhaps the result of Rustam’s own preternatural link to the animal world. Raksh is capable of understanding Rustam in ways that Rustam himself does not seem to grasp. During Rustam’s third trial Raksh remembers Rustam’s insistence that Raksh wake him the next time there is a threat to their lives and so rouses Rustam upon hearing the dragon’s roar (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 45 and 48). Unfortunately, Rustam remains unaware of the threat, and most be awoken several more times before finally addressing the monster.\n\nDespite their quibbles, Rustam is invested in Raksh’s safety – even if only to save himself the trouble of walking – and this brothers in arms relationship between them has earned Rustam trust. Here Raksh is pictured hiding outside the cave and awaiting Rustam’s return, his eyes wide and ears drawn back. Raksh is on edge - waiting for the slightest hint of danger and yet he stands firm trusting Rustam to return – he will not abandon his charge.\n\nZoroastrian beliefs hold that, like humans, animals are integral to the cosmic war between good and evil – some, like cattle and sheep, are the creations of Ahura Mazda and aligned with the cosmic good, while others, snakes and frogs, are the agents of Ahriman and must be destroyed (Foltz 2010). Raksh’s loyalty to Rustam may be an indication that Rustam is on the righteous path and reflects Ahura Mazda’s support."},

    "description":"“So Rustam paused till noon, then, having bound Ulad fast with the lasso, mounted Raksh” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 59)\n\nUlad enters the story by confronting Rustam for tearing the ears off one of Ulad’s watchmen and setting Raksh loose amidst their crops. Unfortunately for him, Rustam proves the superior fighter and he slays Ulad’s company and takes him prisoner. Kidnapped, and bound by threat of violence to guide Rustam on his journey, Ulad is literally dragged into Rustam’s quarrel with the forces of Mazandaran (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 52-56). Here, he is depicted bound to the tree by Rustam’s lasso, wearing an expression of resignation – this is not the first time Ulad has found himself in this position and he betrays no sign of struggle. For his loyalty to Rustam, and guidance along the journey, Ulad will be rewarded with the Kingship of Mazandaran – though at this point in their quest Ulad seems to see his fate as a trial to be endured.\n\nFrom the Zoroastrian perspective, Ulad’s tale maybe considered one of penitence and absolution. The world is a microcosm of the cosmic war between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman and all actions benefit one or the other (Foltz 2010). By hindering Rustam’s righteous crusade against the Div’s of Mazandaran, Ulad has inadvertently abetted the forces of evil and Ahriman. Therefore, his capture and guidance serve to offset the accidental evil he committed and for this Ulad is rewarded.\n\nUlad’s capture may also have a political message. During the time of Firdowsi, the Arab conquest of Persia had seen a repression of Persian culture and language and the Shahnameh was part of the rekindling of Persian identity (Farhat-Holzman 2001). Taken in this light, Ulad may represent Persian identity in the face of an overpowering conqueror – after all, one day Rustam must return home and when he does Ulad will be King of Mazandaran."},

    "description":"“Could I have carried to Mazandaran, My helmet, tigerskin, bow, lasso, sword and massive mace?” ~ Rustam (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 45)\n\nRustam is well-equipped for violent heroics – his quiver is fastened to his thigh and his leopard skin helmet and characteristic tiger-skin armour set him apart. His lasso is binding Ulad to the tree and his sword is nowhere to be seen in the dark of the cave.\n\nBeing clad in the skin of a tiger and crowned with a leopard pelt is more than a fashion statement: it alludes to Rustam’s place in the world. His helmet is reminiscent of Gayumars, the just king who taught his subjects to clothe themselves in the skins of leopards and Rustam’s distant ancestor (Firdawsi 1010, 1: 118-120). The helm also sets Rustam apart as a man of honor and possessed of Farr – the Zoroastrian concept of divine glory. He is literally wearing Gayumars’ wisdom around his head.\n\nThe tiger-skin armor reflects Rustam’s connections to the animal world and his status as a liminal figure. Zoroastrian tradition views cats as servants of Ahriman (Foltz 2010), considering this, Rustam’s garb paints him as a man clothed as a beast. He is gruff and distasteful yet loyal and virtuous, prone to bouts of violence yet true to his word."},

    "description":"“Yet like a lion enraged, he struck full at the Div and lopped from that enormous bulk a hand and foot” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60)\n\nIn the darkness of the cave, Rustam finds his quarry fast asleep. Yet rather than claim the easy victory, Rustam rouses the Div with a battlecry. The White Div makes for a fearsome foe: he grabs a millstone and rushes Rustam through the gloom. Struck by a moment of despair, Rustam is very nearly paralyzed with fright, until his animal instincts rouse him to action and with one fell swoop Rustam lops off the Div’s hand and foot (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60).\n\nFor Rustam, this is a triumph of the animal over the human. It is his animal instincts that snap him out of his petrification and which focuses his attention to survival. By contrast, the White Div, having been grievously maimed, falls prey to despair and laments the loss of his imposing stature. Caught by his vanity, the Div loses his will to survive and Rustam overpowers him (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60).\n\nPictured here is the stump of the White Div’s severed leg, crimson blood pouring from the wound. Nearby, his severed hand still clutches at Rustam’s knee. It is a terrible sight made starker by the startling bright colour of blood against the dark cave background."},

    "description":"“He reached out, clutched the div, raised him neck high, and dashed the life-breath from him upon the ground.” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60)\n\nWho is the White Div and what makes Rustam’s struggle with him important?\n\nThe White Div is an ally of the sorcerer-king of Mazandaran and commander of the army; a shapeshifting beast of terrible power and a dark reflection of Rustam. They are both figures of heroic stature in the service of a greater political power. They are both renowned for their strength. They both have one foot in the realm of humanity and one in the realm of animals. Where Rustam is a man who clothes himself in the skins of beasts, the White Div is a beast who wears the “skin” of humanity through shapeshifting. He is Rustam’s foil – a version of the hero who has sided with evil.\n\nThis duality is reflected in similar depictions as a motif of reflected pose. Where the Div leans back, Rustam leans forward, both figures have one leg stretched out and the other incongruous – either hidden or removed – and they are both reaching out to grab the other. This symmetry of pose is even more apparent in the depiction from the Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh despite the century separating the two manuscripts. From the motion in Rustam and the White Div’s clothing to the circle created in the negative space between their arms, the reflection is evident. Rustam Gazes at the White Div as though seeing himself in a mirror.\n\nSuch similarities hint to the Shahnameh’s importance to Persian culture. Born from a period of cultural revival (Farhat-Holzman 2001), the Shahnameh and the practice of gifting illuminated manuscripts of it persisted through both the Timurid and Saffavid dynasties. Furthermore, the compositional similarities between these two manuscripts illustrates the artistic rivalry and exchange that happened within Persia during the 15th and 16th centuries (Robinson 1958)."},

    "description":"“Then with a dagger, stabbed him to the heart” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60)\n\nHaving overpowered the White Div, Rustam seizes his moment of victory and plunges his dagger into the div’s heart. His quest achieved, he cuts out the White Div’s liver and returns to Shah Kai Kaus with Ulad in tow (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 60-62).\n\nFor the story, this moment means many things: Shah Kai Kaus’ salvation, the end of Rustam’s trials – though not the end of his adventures. There are hints of a Persian victory over their opressors (Ferhat-Holzman 2001) and of a small victory for good in the grand cosmic struggle (Foltz 2010). Given their similarity, in defeating the White Div, Rustam may well have overcome his own temptations towards evil.\n\nYet the artist does not depict Rustam’s victory, unlike Mir Mussavir and Abd al-Vahhab, instead they chose to illustrate the climactic moment of Rustam’s battle with the white div – why? There is a sense of uncertainty and motion present in the Ouseley Manuscript that is absent from Mussavir and al-Vahhab’s painting. By depicting this moment, the Ouseley Manuscript’s artist focuses on the choice that Rustam faces: will he follow through? This harkens back to Zoroastrianism once more. It reminds us that choosing the path of righteousness is a struggle and that there is always the chance of failure, even when victory seems assured. Rustam’s success is in his own hands now, but unlike in the epic or the Shah Tahmasp illustration, the Ouseley miniature maintains the question leaving the audience holding our breath as his dagger remains forever suspended in the moment just before its fall."},
