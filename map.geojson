    "description":"\"“The Seventh Course: How Rustam Slays the White Div” (Firdawsi 1010, 59)\n\nThe Shahnameh is a masterpiece of epic poetry made more captivating by the rich illuminations that have decorated copies of its verses since the 13th century (Clinton and Simpson 2006). The true depth of understanding requires that we consider the Shahnameh in all its complexities: the interplay between Islam and Zoroastrianism, its position as a magnum opus within Persian culture and the censorship and translation difficulties it has endured (Lewis 2015). When faced with such a manuscript as this, we must consider the cultural and political value of the stories to the Persian people (Ferhat-Holzman 2001) and the artistic evolution in manuscript production that arose out of Timurid Persia (Robinson 1958).\n\nThis manuscript was commissioned in the mid 15th century by the Timurid king Ibrahim Sultan of Shiraz for his brother Baysungur of Herat – one more piece in the artistic and cultural rivalry that existed between the two cities (Robinson 1958). The Shahnameh itself is an account of Persian history that arose from the Arab conquest of Persia and is an affirmation of the oppressed Persian culture and language through its subjects and poetry (Ferhat-Holzman 2001). It contains hints of Zoroastrian influence preserved in spite of Islamic censorship (Lewis 2015) such as the themes of conflict between cosmic good and evil – a battle for which all people must one day pledge a side (Foltz 2010).\n\nThe foundation laid, let’s proceed with the story-\n\nHow Rustam Slays the White Div\n\nUnder the guidance of Ulad, the hero, Rustam, has arrived in the city where Shah Kai Kaus is being held captive along with the rest of the Iranian army. The Shah has been blinded by his captors and victory for the Iranians remains out of reach, but with Rustam’s aid they may begin to turn the tide. First, they must cure the blindness afflicting the Shah and remove the threat of the White Div and his armies…(Firdawsi 1010, 57-59)\" (Hebert & Dempsey)"},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
