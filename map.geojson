    "description":"\"“The Seventh Course: How Rustam Slays the White Div” (Firdawsi 1010, 59)\n\nThe Shahnameh is a masterpiece of epic poetry made more captivating by the rich illuminations that have decorated copies of its verses since the 13th century (Clinton and Simpson 2006). The true depth of understanding requires that we consider the Shahnameh in all its complexities: the interplay between Islam and Zoroastrianism, its position as a magnum opus within Persian culture and the censorship and translation difficulties it has endured (Lewis 2015). When faced with such a manuscript as this, we must consider the cultural and political value of the stories to the Persian people (Ferhat-Holzman 2001) and the artistic evolution in manuscript production that arose out of Timurid Persia (Robinson 1958).\n\nThis manuscript was commissioned in the mid 15th century by the Timurid king Ibrahim Sultan of Shiraz for his brother Baysungur of Herat – one more piece in the artistic and cultural rivalry that existed between the two cities (Robinson 1958). The Shahnameh itself is an account of Persian history that arose from the Arab conquest of Persia and is an affirmation of the oppressed Persian culture and language through its subjects and poetry (Ferhat-Holzman 2001). It contains hints of Zoroastrian influence preserved in spite of Islamic censorship (Lewis 2015) such as the themes of conflict between cosmic good and evil – a battle for which all people must one day pledge a side (Foltz 2010).\n\nThe foundation laid, let’s proceed with the story-\n\nHow Rustam Slays the White Div\n\nUnder the guidance of Ulad, the hero, Rustam, has arrived in the city where Shah Kai Kaus is being held captive along with the rest of the Iranian army. The Shah has been blinded by his captors and victory for the Iranians remains out of reach, but with Rustam’s aid they may begin to turn the tide. First, they must cure the blindness afflicting the Shah and remove the threat of the White Div and his armies…(Firdawsi 1010, 57-59)\""},

    "description":"\"“He took Ulad and made Raksh go like wind” (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 59)\n\nRustam, like many other heroes, relies upon his trusty steed Raksh for transport, companionship, and even defence. Rustam’s connection with Raksh verges upon the supernatural – perhaps the result of Rustam’s own preternatural link to the animal world. Raksh is capable of understanding Rustam in ways that Rustam himself does not seem to grasp. During Rustam’s third trial Raksh remembers Rustam’s insistence that Raksh wake him the next time there is a threat to their lives and so rouses Rustam upon hearing the dragon’s roar (Firdawsi 1010, 2: 45 and 48). Unfortunately, Rustam remains unaware of the threat, and most be awoken several more times before finally addressing the monster.\n\nDespite their quibbles, Rustam is invested in Raksh’s safety – even if only to save himself the trouble of walking – and this brothers in arms relationship between them has earned Rustam trust. Here Raksh is pictured hiding outside the cave and awaiting Rustam’s return, his eyes wide and ears drawn back. These are signs of a horse on edge, yet Raksh stands firm trusting Rustam to return – he will not abandon his charge.\n\nZoroastrian beliefs hold that, like humans, animals are integral to the cosmic war between good and evil – some, like cattle and sheep, are the creations of Ahura Mazda and aligned with the cosmic good, while others, snakes and frogs, are the agents of Ahriman and must be destroyed (Foltz 2010). Raksh’s loyalty to Rustam may be an indication that Rustam is on the righteous path and reflects Ahura Mazda’s support.\""},
